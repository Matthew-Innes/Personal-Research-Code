# Personal-Research-Code
This is my code for the research I am conducting regarding multi-party-computation. I am conducting this research under the advice of Dr. Kiwan Maeng of Pennsylvania State University. My main focus is to investigate the possible improvements of computing time and expense of multi-party computing along with secure machine learning models.
